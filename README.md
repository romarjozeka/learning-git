# learning-git

The purpose of this project is for learning and practising git, github and a git gui client.

After following online courses and reading Git Pro book, i decided to properly apply the knowledge.

This project will include git features like branches, merging, tags to name but a few.

A template was used by w3scools, https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_parallax.htm to speed the process.

Locally, Git Kraken will be used to visualize the history and ease working with git.
